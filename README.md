# FibonacciHeap
This project implements the Fibonacci Heap data structure in Java, a powerful and efficient heap structure with applications in graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and Prim's. The project includes:
- A fully functional Java implementation (`FibonacciHeap.java`)
- A comprehensive explanation of the Fibonacci Heap in the accompanying documen
